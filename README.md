# Traveller

Traveller is an online travel information sharing platform designed for travelers who want to document and share their travel experiences with others. The application allows users to publish travel posts that include destinations, dates, descriptions, and images. Other users can browse shared trips, view detailed travel information, and leave comments to interact with the content. The goal of this project is to create a simple, community-driven space where travelers exchange experiences, recommendations, and inspiration.
